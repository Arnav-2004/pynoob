# Miscellaneous

Beyond its core functionalities, Python offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools that enable developers to tackle various tasks efficiently. We will delve into several miscellaneous topics in Python, including regular expressions, working with dates and times, functional programming, and working with APIs and web scraping.

## 1. Regular Expressions

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, provide a powerful and flexible means of matching strings of text. In Python, the `re` module provides support for regular expressions.

### i. Key Concepts:

- **Metacharacters:** Special characters in regex with a specific meaning, such as `^`, `$`, `*`, `+`, `?`, etc.
- **Quantifiers:** Used to specify the number of occurrences of a character or group, like `*`, `+`, `?`, `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}`.
- **Character Classes:** Allows matching of specific characters, like `\d` for digits, `\w` for word characters, `\s` for whitespace, etc.
- **Grouping and Capturing:** Parentheses `()` are used to group characters together, and also capture the matched text.
- **Anchors:** Specify the position in the text where the match must occur, such as `^` for start of string, `$` for end of string, `\b` for word boundary, etc.

### ii. Example:

```python
import re

# Matching phone numbers in a string
text = "Call me at 555-123-4567 or 555-987-6543"
pattern = r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}'
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['555-123-4567', '555-987-6543']
```

### iii. Resources:

- Python `re` module documentation: [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- Online regex tester: [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/)

## 2. Working with Dates and Times

Python's standard library provides the `datetime` module for working with dates and times.

### i. Key Concepts:

- **`datetime` Module:** Provides classes for manipulating dates and times, including `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `timedelta`, etc.
- **Parsing and Formatting:** Methods like `strptime()` and `strftime()` allow converting between datetime objects and strings.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** `timedelta` objects can be added or subtracted from dates to perform date arithmetic.
- **Timezones:** The `pytz` module or the built-in `timezone` class can be used to work with timezones.

### ii. Example:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Current date and time
now = datetime.now()
print(now)

# Format datetime as string
formatted_date = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(formatted_date)

# Adding 7 days to current date
future_date = now + timedelta(days=7)
print(future_date)
```

### iii. Resources:

- Python `datetime` module documentation: [docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- `pytz` module documentation: [pypi.org/project/pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)

## 3. Functional Programming in Python

Python supports functional programming paradigms, enabling the use of functions as first-class objects.

### i. Key Concepts:

- **First-Class Functions:** Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from other functions.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
- **Lambda Functions:** Anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.
- **Map, Filter, and Reduce:** Built-in functions for functional-style programming operations on iterables.

### ii. Example:

```python
# Using map and lambda to double each element in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
print(doubled)

# Using filter and lambda to filter even numbers
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)

# Using reduce to find the product of all elements in a list
from functools import reduce
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
print(product)
```

### iii. Resources:

- Functional programming in Python documentation: [docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)

## 4. Working with APIs and Web Scraping

Python provides several libraries for working with APIs and web scraping, including `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Scrapy`.

### i. Key Concepts:

- **`requests` Library:** Used for making HTTP requests to APIs and websites.
- **API Integration:** Interacting with web services to fetch or send data, typically in JSON format.
- **Web Scraping:** Extracting data from web pages programmatically, often using HTML parsing libraries like `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Scrapy:** A powerful web crawling framework for scraping websites at scale.

### ii. Example:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Fetching data from an API
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
print(data)

# Scraping data from a web page
url = 'https://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
title = soup.find('title').text
print(title)
```

### iii. Resources:

- `BeautifulSoup` documentation: [www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
